## Database schema

See [DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for the entity-relationship diagram,
column types, and current database constraints.

Schema changes are versioned and are not run by normal application startup. For
a new database, or to register the existing schema before upgrading the app,
run the migration command explicitly:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m register.migrations
```

The runner verifies required columns and the unique listening-event key before
recording a migration version. It stops rather than silently altering an
existing table whose schema does not match.

`SPOTY_DISPLAY_TIMEZONE` accepts an IANA timezone name and defaults to
`Europe/Rome`, which follows Italy's daylight-saving rules. Set it to
`Europe/Madrid` to use Spain's local time instead.

## Operation logging

Spotify requests, authentication, response validation, and local liked-track
writes emit JSON diagnostics through the `spoty.operations` logger. They appear
on stderr in the terminal running Streamlit or a script, and in GitHub Actions
job output. No external logging service or log file is required.

Events include `operation`, `provider`, `run_id`, `duration_ms`, error category,
and HTTP status or `retry_after` when available. `run_id` identifies an operation
or grouped incident within a process, not an entire GitHub Actions job.
Raw exceptions, request arguments, tokens, OAuth callback codes, DSNs, and
response payloads are excluded from these diagnostic events.

At the default `INFO` level, the logger reports a failure once per operation and
error category. Repeated failures are counted silently until a successful,
validated response emits `operation_recovered` with the same ID and count.
Normal successful operations are only visible at `DEBUG`. Logs do not add UI alerts.

To enable detailed operation events, set the level before starting the process:

```powershell
$env:SPOTY_LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Use `INFO` for normal operation. Changing the level requires restarting the
process. Existing progress prints and third-party logs are separate from this
logger; this step does not replace all repository output or change retry policy.
